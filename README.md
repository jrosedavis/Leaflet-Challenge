# Leaflet Homework - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Summary: 
* Build a new set of tools that will allow the USGS to visualize their earthquake data. 

## Files:
* 'Leaflet1' folder includes final index.html for visualizations and 'static' folder which include CSS and JS files.

## Instructions:

### Level 1: Basic Visualization

* **Get your data set**
   * Visit the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page and pick a data set to visualize.

* **Import & Visualize the Data**
   * Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from data set based on their longitude and latitude.
   * Data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
